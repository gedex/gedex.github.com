Recently I’m writing a [buku-template](https://github.com/gedex/template-buku), another open source project to write html book in Markdown. I’m planning to write books about programming that freely available on the web. My books, of course, will be on Bahasa Indonesia. Buku-template itself is a script that converts chapters written in Markdown into html file. You can test it by cloning the repo and run `bin/build.py`, sample chapters (book titled “Belajar Bahasa Lorem Ipsum Cara Susah”) is provided. Wish me luck with my new book!
