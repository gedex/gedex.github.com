This is the first time [go-instagram](https://github.com/gedex/go-instagram) get tagged, 0.2.

Changelog:

- Completed test for all Services.
- Returns pagination for Services whose the first return value is a slice.

[ginsta](https://github.com/gedex/ginsta) is the first app using go-instagram heavily.
I made ginsta as an app for go-instagram functionality test. Since there's major
changes in go-instagram, ginsta will be updated soon.
