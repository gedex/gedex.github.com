I saw my Google+' friend shared about [Code for Vote 2.0](http://apipemilu.tumblr.com/post/87895708899/api-pemilu-code-for-vote-2-0-challenge).
It's application (Web, Mobile, or anything) competition in which the app must
consumes data from Pemilu API endpoints. I interested to partipate by coding
an SPA (Single Page Application) in less than a day. Then [Info Capres 2014](https://github.com/gedex/info-capres-2014)
was born. As the deadline was extended, I added more features like login and
"support candidate" action via [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com). Although
my app wasn't elected into 60 candidates, I was able to learn enough about
Firebase. My app, Info Capres 2014, is an open source one with MIT license, and hosted
in [GitHub](https://github.com/gedex/info-capres-2014). Check it out if you're
interested!
