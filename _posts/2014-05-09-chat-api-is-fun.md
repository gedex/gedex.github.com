I've been playing with Slack and HipChat API lately. It's fun! I'm seeing [Slack](https://slack.com) and
[HipChat](https://hipchat.com) are two big players in chat service nowadays with client in web and native apps
and, of course, HTTP API. There's [Campfire](https://campfirenow.com), but I felt discouraged to play with it
when they ask credit card information for the sake of trying. Not because I felt insecure, but I don't have
damn credit card!

Slack and HipChat are so kind, it's free under limited circumstances. But hey! I can play with their API.
If you've a site powered by WordPress then give a try my [Slack](http://wordpress.org/plugins/slack) and
[HipChat](http://wordpress.org/plugins/better-hipchat) plugins. It allows you to get notification in your
room/channel when certain events in WordPress occured. I don't give up with Campire, instead I'm looking
volunteer who has Campfire account where I can play with its API by giving me access to your account.
The end result will be a Campire WordPress plugin with the same features as Slack and HipChat plugins.
