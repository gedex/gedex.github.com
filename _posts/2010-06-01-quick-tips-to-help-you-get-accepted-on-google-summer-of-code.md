I’ve great news that, AFAIK, there are two students from Indonesia that
have been accepted on Google Summer of Code 2010. They are (drum roll please)
[Akeda][1] and [Dwi][2]. I’ve been posted a message on gsoc student mailing list
to alert other Indonesian students, but no one replying. So, I guess there’s
only me and dwi get accepted this year.Since, I’ve accepeted
I’ll give my own tips on how to get accepted as a student of
Google Summer of Code.

The key is write a good proposal and communicate with your mentoring project oftenly.
A good proposal is not your first try proposal. When you writing your
proposal for the first time oftenly it’s just a draft proposal.
You need to ask your mentoring project some feedbacks and iterate the
process by rewrite and ask again until the mentoring project says okay.
This year is a little bit different, some mentoring organisations posts
some bugs tagged for applicants and each applicant should work, on bug(s)
by submitting patch for that bug. I did this. Doing this means your
chance to get attentions from mentoring organisation is higher.
So, you need to touch the codebase of the project which you have interest
on it. Because of this you shouldn’t have to submit a proposal as much
as you think to get accepted. The increased quantity of your proposals
may even decreased overall proposal qualities, since you have to split
your focus.


Okay, you’ve got the picture? Alright, how about the content of good proposal?
Some mentoring organisations were kind enough to give us templates of proposal
to work on. The templates are general as it should have a brief description
about the project you have interested in, implementation plans, timeline and
short biography about yourself. You should focus (IMHO) on writing your
implementation plans and timeline. A google summer of code project is
around 3 or 4 months duration, so it can be said as a medium project for
a single developer. The key is how good you describe the problem and its
solution. When you touched the codebase of a project for submitting patch,
you get the benefits on how you’ll describe the software on your proposal.
Use the name of the classes, methods, libraries that related to your project
and how you’ll using it to solve the problem. Mentoring organisations will
pick up student that already familiar with their codebase.
Don’t write too much, use screenshots if available. If your project is
a complex one, divide your project into three or four subprojects then
define the timeline of each subprojects. Well, that’s my own quick tips.
I hope Indonesian students will aware about this event on the next year.
