Haha.. what a day!! so i met doni mokondo at T19.  Dony is  one of my fella, he was my first roommate at nabila. Geez.. he looks different with long hair and bloated belly (even i and kumiz didn’t recognize himself at first sight). Doni still obsessed to be a musician, so he gave me his demo songs (eh.. signed band right?). OK fella, rock and roll..
