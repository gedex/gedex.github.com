When you have tried (err.. don’t forget to pray), here they are, three kinds of asnwers you might get from Allah:

1.  Allah gives you what you want (Alhamdulillah)
2.  Not this time, you might get better if you’re waiting
3.  No, you’ll get the best later

So, if you didn’t make it, there are two possibilities you’ll get more than what you want. I quote this wish sentences from someone,  thanks for giving me this hint.
