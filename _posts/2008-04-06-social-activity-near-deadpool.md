I’ve just read Ted’s post regarding to [Tapal Batas’s Concert][1]. Ted, sometimes you were awesome, how can be?
As a Bekasian, i never think about Bekasi. How IT guys, such us, never think in a moment for social contribution, like Mr. Gendu did ? I hope when **we** grow up, we could make a proportional act. Not just search, but also donate. That’s it. So guys, rather than spending our money for celebrating graduation, why don’t we donate our money?
