excerpt: Yet another Martini-powered RESTful API with Backbone-powered client consuming the API.
---

I've been playing with Go [Martini](https://github.com/go-martini/martini) lately.
Another little project was born, called [yet-another-simple-note](https://github.com/gedex/yet-another-simple-note).
The project shows an example how to create REST API easily with Martini and how Backbone
can be used to consume the API.
