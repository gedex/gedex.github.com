In fact, i hate this situation. When you get crazy with someone, and her shadow always haunting your mind, what you should do? Just tell her, that’s it. It doesn’t matter how she reacts your statement. Hopefully, her shadow disappears and you can journey as usual. Never blame this as her fault, this phenomena can’t be formulated in math *for the sake of Einstein*. Sometimes, girls don’t understand your clues, although they were armed with very sensitive feeling which they hide it for unknown reason. However, they just want to be heard. Meanwhile, man was armed with ego which he battles it sometimes. Glad, i could pulldown my ego. Remember what old pa said:

> Gravitation is not responsible for people falling in love. – Albert Einstein
