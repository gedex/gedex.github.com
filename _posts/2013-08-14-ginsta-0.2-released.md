This is the first time [ginsta](https://github.com/gedex/ginsta) get tagged, 0.2.

Changelog:

- Completed all basic commands.

In the future I'd like to add following features:

* `users` commands:

   {%highlight text %}
   $ download_user_media [-path PATH] [USER_ID]
   $ download_user_liked_media [-path PATH]
   {%endhighlight text %}

* `media` commands:

   {%highlight text %}
   $ download_media_by_id [MEDIA_ID]
   $ download_popular_media
   {%endhighlight text %}

* `tags` commands:

   {%highlight text %}
   $ download_recent_media_by_tag [-min_id MIN_ID] [-max_id MAX_ID] [TAG_NAME]
   {%endhighlight text %}
