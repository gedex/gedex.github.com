This site is powered by Jekyll and Github pages and available on
[my repo][1]. Layout was bootstrapped with [HTML5 boilerplate][2].

Previously this domain ran a blog powered by WordPress and
migrated using Ben Balter's plugin.

## Header and Footer style
The nice looking header and footer was stolen from [month-picker][3]

## Typography
Inspired by [Tommi Kaikkonen's Guide on Typography][4].

* **Heading &rarr;** Source Sans Pro
* **Body and paragraph &rarr;** Crimson Text
* **Code &rarr;** Droid Sans Mono
