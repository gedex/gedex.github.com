Have you felt bored? Then, what did you do to handle such boring situation? Blogwalking? Solving “monkey” challenges? Or, maybe, doing illegal activities? (Ehmm.. these questions for people mostly sitting infront of computer). Unplug your internet connection for couple days, if necessary turn off your computer. No blogwalking, coding, designing, emailing, playing games or whatever you do with your computer. Now, what happens? For me, sorry.. this is my opinion, boring times are something happens to people who don’t understand why they live in earth. Get a real life, you have a God, family and friends in real world ! :)   (doohh.. apaa.. sih?) .
