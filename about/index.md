Since 2010 I’ve been working as a lecturer at Gunadarma University. I taught everything about computer which

## Programmer
I’ve been a programmer since I was in college. My first interest in computing was Embedded System. I built simple embedded
system and robot. Participated in robot competition with my friends and get paid lower for college's work.
Later on, I taught myself web programming. With self-taught skill on web
