## Work experiences
Since 2010 I’ve been working as a lecturer at Gunadarma University. I taught everything about computer which
I doubt I'm able to. I also teached for IGOS (Indonesia Goes Open Source) Bekasi in my weekend.
In 2013 I resigned from Gunadarma University and stopped being an IGOS' teacher.

I’ve been an engineer since I was in college. My first interest was embedded system. I built simple embedded
system and robot, participated in robot competition with my friends and get paid for doing college's work on embedded problem.

Later on, I taught myself web programming. With self-taught skill on web
programming I was able to work for number of clients incluuding PP, Samudera Indonesia, CNOOC, BMW Indonesia, Sudin Jakarta Timur,
etc. In 2010, I was Google Summer of Code participant for [Improve Configuration project][3]. The code has been merged in
[1.8 beta release][4]. In 2011 I participated again as GSoC student for [Melange Organization][5].

Now, I work for [X-Team](http://x-team.com).
