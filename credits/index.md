This site is powered by Jekyll and Github pages and available on
[my repo][1]. Layout was bootstrapped with [HTML5 boilerplate][2].

Previously this domain ran a blog powered by Wordpress and
migrated using Ben Balter's plugin.

## Header and Footer style
The nice looking header and footer was stolen from [month-picker][3]
